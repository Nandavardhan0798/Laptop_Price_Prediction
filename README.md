# Laptop_Price_Prediction
A machine learning project that predicts laptop prices based on specs like RAM, storage, CPU, GPU, and screen resolution. It includes data preprocessing, model evaluation, hyperparameter tuning, and deployment using Streamlit. Ideal for learning regression techniques and end-to-end ML deployment.

# üíª Laptop Price Predictor

A Machine Learning web application that predicts the price of a laptop based on its specifications using various regression models. Built with **Scikit-learn**, deployed using **Streamlit**, and trained on real-world laptop data.

## üîç Project Overview

This project aims to provide an estimated price of a laptop based on the following features:

- Company
- Type (Notebook, Ultrabook, Gaming, etc.)
- Screen Size
- Screen Resolution
- CPU
- RAM
- Storage (SSD/HDD)
- GPU
- Operating System
- Weight

The best-performing model was selected and integrated into a Streamlit web app for easy predictions.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Tech Stack

- Python
- Scikit-learn
- Pandas, NumPy
- Streamlit
- Matplotlib & Seaborn (for visualization)
- GridSearchCV for hyperparameter tuning

## üöÄ How to Run the Project Locally

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/laptop-price-predictor.git
cd laptop-price-predictor
